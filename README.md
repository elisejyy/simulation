# Flu Pandemic Simulation
I used SimPy to simulate a flu pandemic in a classroom of students. Each of the 20 students has a 0.2 probability of getting infected and once sick, are infectious for three days. Once they recover, they cannot become sick again. This project simulates how long the pandemic will last.
